## Template #4: The 52% Manual Problem

**Subject:** 52% still manual: The hidden cost of not automating

**Email Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

This statistic stopped me in my tracks: 52% of warehouses are still mostly manual operations.

Even more surprising? That number is UP from 43% last year.

**Why are companies moving backward on automation?**
→ "It's too expensive" (but manual labor costs are rising 15-20% annually)
→ "It's too complex" (but modern solutions are plug-and-play)
→ "We're not ready" (but waiting costs compound daily)

**The real cost of staying manual:**
→ 3-5x higher error rates than automated systems
→ 40-60% more time spent on repetitive tasks
→ Inability to scale during peak seasons
→ Higher worker injury rates and turnover

**Good news:** You don't need to automate everything at once.

**Smart automation starter pack:**
✅ Conveyor systems for high-volume routes ($25K investment)
✅ Pick-to-light systems for accuracy ($15K investment)
✅ Automated packaging stations ($35K investment)

**Combined impact:** 30-40% productivity increase, 18-month payback

[Customer example] started with just conveyor systems connecting their top 3 pick zones. Result: 25% faster picking, 60% fewer walking miles per shift.

Six months later, they added voice picking. Now they're planning full automation.

**Start small, scale smart.**
