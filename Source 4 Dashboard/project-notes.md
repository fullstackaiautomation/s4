# Source 4 Dashboard â€“ Session Notes (2025-10-22)

## Completed This Session
- Implemented all navigation targets referenced in the PRD, including Marketing analytics views, Sales dashboards, Upload workflows, Admin modules, and Automations pages.
- Added supporting UI components (inline alerts, upload wizard, SKU filters, review generator) and wired each page to Supabase-backed data services with sample fallbacks for missing credentials.
- Verified linting with `npm run lint`; project compiles with new routes and components.

## Next Actions
- Connect production Supabase tables and disable sample fallbacks once live data is available.
- Build ingestion automation (upload handlers, Supabase Edge Functions, materialized views) for Monthly Dashboard and Reviews workflows.
- Implement authentication and RBAC; Branding/Logins placeholders remain pending Phase 2.
- Add automated testing coverage and CI integration for lint/tests.
- Conduct UX polish pass (loading states, error handling, responsive tweaks) and gather stakeholder feedback before launch.
