## Next Steps for Category Assignment

### Using the Ad Spend Processor Skill

The skill scripts are ready to:

1. **Auto-suggest categories** for all 837 products using:
   - SKU patterns from titles
   - Vendor-specific category rules
   - Keyword matching with confidence scoring

2. **Generate reports** including:
   - `category_suggestions.csv` - All products with HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence suggestions
   - `monthly_ad_spend_report.xlsx` - Three sheets:
     - Vendor Spend totals
     - Category Spend totals
     - Vendor × Category cross-tabulation

3. **Detect missing SKUs** - Flag any products without SKU mappings

### Confidence Scoring System

- **HIGH (≥70%):** Strong keyword matches, likely correct
- **MEDIUM (40-69%):** Partial matches, validate before approving
- **LOW (<40%):** Weak signals, needs manual review
